# AI for Medical Diagnoses

Welcome to my repository showcasing a suite of deep learning projects aimed at improving medical diagnosis across imaging modalities and diseases. Each subproject addresses unique challenges in clinical AI—from data imbalance to interpretability—while emphasizing reproducibility, fairness, and real-world utility.

**List of projects thus far:**
1. [AI for Chest XRay Diagnosis](https://github.com/francktchafa/AI-for-Medical-Diagnoses/tree/main/AI%20for%20Chest%20XRay%20Diagnosis): A multilabel classifier to predict the presence or absence 14 thoracic diseases.
